# LinkedIn Network Explorer â€” Simple (Streamlit)

testing out an initial idea, feel free to use it (super slow currently)

Upload your LinkedIn `connections.csv` and explore:
- Interactive, draggable network
- Super connectors (degree + betweenness)
- Find connectors to reach a target (company/domain/role/keywords)

## Run locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

fucked up the ETL pipeline lmao, lemme fix it in a bit
